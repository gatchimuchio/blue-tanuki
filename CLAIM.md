# BLUE-TANUKI v1.0 RC Claim Boundary

## Claim

BLUE-TANUKI v1.0 RC is a local, owner-operated resident control plane built around **HDS-BRAIN**.

The core claim is not "more channels than OpenClaw."

The core claim is:

```text
No black box in BLUE-TANUKI's HDS authority path.
```

Meaning:

- actor is resolved as structured data
- process is resolved as structured data
- process authority policy is enforced before command emission
- execution policy is enforced before executor handoff
- approval operation/scope/risk/final-review status is resolved as structured data
- memory hits are traced and explicitly not used for authority escalation
- decisions, approvals, command lifecycle, and executor feedback are recorded in a hash-chain audit log

## Non-claim

BLUE-TANUKI does not claim that the following are internally transparent:

- OS kernel
- network providers
- Telegram / Slack / Discord / Teams / LINE platforms
- LLM providers
- browser engines
- external APIs
- user-provided tools

The transparency claim is limited to BLUE-TANUKI's own authority path.
