# BLUE-TANUKI portable installers

These scripts are the Phase 6-S3 installer layer. They do not build signed
native packages yet; they install a portable BLUE-TANUKI app directory, run the
existing setup flow, and create a launcher.

## Distribution readiness

`doctor` checks that this installer guide, update/rollback guidance,
uninstall/purge paths, and release-bundle verification scripts are present
before release. This is an operator-safety gate, not a claim that BLUE-TANUKI
ships as a signed native product or has an automatic updater.
The portable installer does not build signed native packages yet.
Use the uninstall dry-run option before destructive removal when available.

## Guided first-run installer

Phase 11-S9 adds a guided first-run wrapper for source and release-bundle users:

```bash
pnpm installer:run
```

This path performs preflight checks, enables Corepack/pnpm when possible, runs
setup, runs `doctor`, and opens the path toward the Control Center settings UI.
It is a guided first-run accelerator, not a verified 5-minute setup guarantee.

Use the Control Center Settings page and the `Verify LLM` action before saving
LLM provider changes. API key values are written only to the env file and are
not printed by the installer, doctor, runtime snapshot, or audit output.

For a non-serving setup pass:

```bash
pnpm installer:run -- --no-serve
```

For local OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

```bash
pnpm installer:run -- --provider openai-compatible --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 --model local-model --no-serve
```

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=22.14.0`
- Corepack or pnpm
- Network access for the first dependency install

## Windows

Run from an extracted release bundle:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\install.ps1
```

Optional:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\install.ps1 -Force
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\install.ps1 -Force -ResetConfig
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\install.ps1 -SkipDoctor
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\uninstall.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\uninstall.ps1 -Purge
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install\windows\uninstall.ps1 -DryRun
```

The installer creates launchers under `%APPDATA%\BlueTanuki\bin`.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" start
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" doctor
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" settings
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" env
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" resident-start
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" resident-status
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" resident-stop
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:APPDATA\BlueTanuki\bin\blue-tanuki.ps1" resident-autostart-enable
```

## macOS

```bash
sh ./install/macos/install.sh
```

Optional:

```bash
FORCE=1 sh ./install/macos/install.sh
FORCE=1 RESET_CONFIG=1 sh ./install/macos/install.sh
RUN_DOCTOR=0 sh ./install/macos/install.sh
sh ./install/macos/uninstall.sh
PURGE=1 sh ./install/macos/uninstall.sh
DRY_RUN=1 sh ./install/macos/uninstall.sh
```

The installer creates `~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki`.

```bash
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki start
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki doctor
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki settings
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki env
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-start
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-status
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-stop
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-autostart-enable
```

## Linux

```bash
sh ./install/linux/install.sh
```

Optional:

```bash
FORCE=1 sh ./install/linux/install.sh
FORCE=1 RESET_CONFIG=1 sh ./install/linux/install.sh
RUN_DOCTOR=0 sh ./install/linux/install.sh
sh ./install/linux/uninstall.sh
PURGE=1 sh ./install/linux/uninstall.sh
DRY_RUN=1 sh ./install/linux/uninstall.sh
```

The installer creates `~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki`.

```bash
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki start
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki doctor
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki settings
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki env
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-start
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-status
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-stop
~/.local/bin/blue-tanuki resident-autostart-enable
```

## Resident app lifecycle

Phase 11-S10 adds portable resident integration commands to the generated
launchers. These commands start the normal Gateway serve process in the
background, report status, open Control Center, show logs, and manage explicit
current-user autostart where supported:

```bash
blue-tanuki resident-start
blue-tanuki resident-status
blue-tanuki resident-open
blue-tanuki resident-logs
blue-tanuki resident-stop
blue-tanuki resident-autostart-status
blue-tanuki resident-autostart-enable
blue-tanuki resident-autostart-disable
```

Autostart is never enabled by install/setup itself. It is only enabled when the
owner runs `resident-autostart-enable`. The resident app path does not provide a
signed native installer and does not implement an automatic updater.

## Settings

After launching, open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/settings
```

Use `BLUE_TANUKI_SETTINGS_TOKEN` from the generated env file. The settings API
edits that env file and requires restart.

## Post-install doctor

Installers run `doctor` after setup by default. Exit code `2` blocks the
install, while exit code `1` is treated as warnings so optional Slack/Discord
or live LLM credentials can remain unset during local setup.

## Reinstall and upgrade

`-Force` on Windows and `FORCE=1` on macOS/Linux replace the app directory but
leave an existing env file intact. The installer preserves WebChat tokens,
resume tokens,
settings tokens, LLM provider settings, audit paths, and session paths stable
across reinstall or portable upgrade.

Use `-ResetConfig` on Windows or `RESET_CONFIG=1` on macOS/Linux only when the
env file should be regenerated intentionally.

When setup or settings overwrites an env file, the previous file is kept as a
timestamped `.bak` file next to the env file.

## Uninstall

Uninstallers remove the installed app and launcher by default while preserving
the env file, audit chain, sessions, and local data. Use `-Purge` on Windows or
`PURGE=1` on macOS/Linux to remove the retained data as well. Use `-DryRun` or
`DRY_RUN=1` to preview the removal.
