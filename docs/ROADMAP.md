# BLUE-TANUKI Roadmap v9

この文書は `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` と同じ実行順序を示す圧縮ロードマップである。
実装時の source of truth は常に `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` と `AGENTS.md`。この文書は人間が全体像を素早く確認するための案内であり、詳細な phase 要件、検証コマンド、acceptance criteria は active instruction file を参照する。

## 0. 不変原則

BLUE-TANUKI は local owner-operated resident AI control plane である。

```md
HDS-BRAIN owns authority.
LLMs, tools, channels, plugins, skills, memory, cron, browser automation, UI, onboarding, update flows, companion apps, and external services are downstream devices.
```

優先順位は固定:

1. Safety
2. Robustness
3. Comfort / UX
4. Feature coverage / channel coverage / extensibility

OpenClaw は設計の出発点ではなく、拒否済み design pattern として扱う。BLUE-TANUKI は feature breadth や channel count ではなく、安全な永続運用を完成条件にする。
