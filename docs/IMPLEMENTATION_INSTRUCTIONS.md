# BLUE-TANUKI Implementation Instructions v9

## Role of This File

This file is the active implementation instruction for Codex / LLM coding agents.

It is not a marketing roadmap.

It is a completion-oriented execution contract from the current repository state to v1.0-class completion.

It incorporates a rejection audit of OpenClaw. OpenClaw is treated as a **rejected design pattern**, not a master plan. BLUE-TANUKI exists because OpenClaw-style strategy produces unsafe software promoted as successful, and Codex must not import OpenClaw assumptions as design starting points.

Use this file with `AGENTS.md`.

If `docs/ROADMAP.md` conflicts with this file, treat `docs/ROADMAP.md` as context and this file as the active execution plan.

---

# 0. Product Definition

BLUE-TANUKI is a local owner-operated resident AI control plane.

Permanent principle:

```md
HDS-BRAIN owns authority.
LLMs, tools, channels, plugins, skills, memory, cron, browser automation, UI, onboarding, update flows, companion apps, and external services are downstream devices.
```

Completion means:

- not maximum feature count,
- not maximum channel count,
- not LLM autonomy,
- not a chatbot clone,
- not superficial "5-minute demo" success,
- but a resident control plane where broad local capability can exist without hidden authority, untraceable side effects, or final-review bypass.

---

# 1. OpenClaw Rejection Audit

## 1.1 Position

OpenClaw is rejected as a design pattern. This section exists only to make the rejection criteria explicit so that no Codex run reintroduces those patterns by drift.

## 1.2 Comparison Target

OpenClaw demonstrates a broad multi-channel assistant strategy:

- onboarding-oriented setup,
- daemon/service installation,
- dashboard/control UI,
- many channels,
- DM pairing / allowlist model,
- doctor/update/rollback docs,
- companion apps / nodes / voice / canvas,
- skills/plugin ecosystem.

BLUE-TANUKI must not copy this as-is.

The comparison question is:

```md
Does this actually make a beginner safely and permanently operational,
or does it only make first contact easy while pushing complexity into long-term operation?
```

## 1.3 Key Finding

OpenClaw-style "5-minute setup" is not equivalent to permanent usability.

Risks:

- first-run success can hide long-term service/config/credential complexity,
- many channels increase failure surface,
- pairing and allowlists improve safety but increase cognitive load,
- daemon/service installation can become opaque under failure,
- updates require package/service/config coordination,
- doctor output must be actionable or it becomes developer-only diagnostics,
- companion apps can improve UX but create extra support surfaces,
- channel count can become a distraction from safe operation.

## 1.4 BLUE-TANUKI Response

BLUE-TANUKI must answer with:

```md
Safety-first permanence.
```

Meaning:

1. HDS authority and final-review remain non-bypassable.
2. First-run path must become simple, but only after the safe path exists.
3. Permanent-use UX is a release gate, not a marketing claim.
4. Channel selection must be intentional.
5. OpenClaw's useful UX patterns are adapted under BLUE-TANUKI's authority model.
6. Unsupported or high-maintenance channels remain preview/third-party/reserved.

## 1.5 Adopt / Adapt / Reject / Reserve

| OpenClaw pattern | Assessment | BLUE-TANUKI action |
|---|---|---|
| Guided onboarding | Useful but can hide complexity | Adapt under HDS/doctor/actionable setup |
| Daemon/service install | Useful for permanence but failure-prone | Adapt after safety kernel |
| Dashboard / Control UI | Useful if it closes next-action loop | Adapt as Control Center |
| Many channels | Feature breadth, high operational burden | Reject as core strategy |
| Telegram as fastest channel | Valid practical starter | Adopt |
| WhatsApp ecosystem | Third-party extension surface, audit/authority boundary cannot be guaranteed | Reject as first-party; reserved-third-party only as deliberate safety + liability boundary |
| DM pairing / allowlist | Strong inbound safety idea | Adapt into owner access model |
| Device/node pairing | Useful later, not core v0.1 | Reserve for v0.3+ |
| Update / rollback docs | Necessary for permanence | Adopt |
| Doctor diagnostics | Necessary only if actionable | Adapt with "what next" output |
| Skills/plugin marketplace | Supply-chain risk | Reject for first-party core |
| Companion apps / voice / canvas | UX-expanding but support-heavy | Reserve for later phases |

---

# 2. Global Completion Strategy

The repository must move through these completion bands:

## Band A — Safety Kernel

Goal:

- authority path closed,
- Approval Gate closed,
- audit closed,
- runtime invariants visible.

Already mostly implemented.

## Band B — v0.1 Completion

Goal:

- local owner setup works,
- WebChat / Telegram smoke works,
- runtime schedule is safe,
- approval levels are first-class,
- operator usability closure exists,
- release bundle and validation pass.

Remaining primary work:

- v0.1 live smoke cleanup
- docs consistency

## Band C — v0.1.x Stabilization

Goal:

- GitHub write downstream tool,
- Slack / Discord release polish,
- browser automation preview,
- stronger live smoke,
- conformance test expansion.

## Band D — v0.2 Capability Expansion

Goal:

- Google integrations,
- Teams / LINE,
- F-reference audit integration,
- memory continuity not authority,
- adapter maturity.

## Band E — v0.3 Resident UX

Goal:

- Control Center polish,
- notification center,
- approval UX,
- settings UX,
- installer experience,
- local app feel.

## Band F — v1.0 Release Hardening

Goal:

- repeatable install,
- documented recovery,
- stable extension boundary,
- security review checklist complete,
- permanent-use UX proven,
- v1.0 support/non-support boundary clear,
- no critical preview paths in main release.

---

# 3. Global Invariants

These must remain true:

```json
{
  "hds_calls_llm": false,
  "process_policy_enforced": true,
  "external_metadata_can_escalate_authority": false,
  "memory_used_for_authority": false,
  "complete_history_used_for_authority": false,
  "final_review_boundary_enforced_by_approval_gate": true
}
```

Do not regress:

- hash-chain audit verification,
- runtime snapshot visibility,
- approval audit trace,
- plugin capability enforcement,
- file root sandbox,
- SSRF guard,
- resume token separation,
- one-time approval token behavior,
- boot-time schedule behavior,
- Daily Brief smoke behavior,
- release bundle secret exclusion,
- setup/config preservation,
- update/rollback clarity.

---

# 4. Current State Assumption

Codex must verify this by grep before coding, but current expected state is:

Completed or mostly completed:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- HDS-BRAIN authority path
- Runtime Invariants
- Approval Gate
- full-access local default
- final-review boundary
- hash-chain audit
- plugin loader
- capability envelope
- WebChat
- Telegram
- Slack release-polished preview
- Discord release-polished preview
- boot-time Daily Brief / generic scheduled messages
- file tools
- http / web search tools
- `github.read`
- `browser.read`
- `shell.exec`
- `github.write`
- local setup/settings/doctor/release bundle
- HDS long-term memory addendum as non-authority memory component
- ApprovalLevel first-class
- runtime schedule CRUD
- OpenClaw rejection audit document

Known gaps:

- Slack / Discord remain preview until owner credentialed live smoke is run
- browser automation is implemented as disabled-by-default preview
- Google write integrations are implemented as bounded L3 downstream tools
- Teams / LINE are implemented as first-party-preview target adapters; owner credentialed live smoke and permanent-use review are still required before first-party promotion
- resident native UX is not complete
- v1.0 hardening is not complete

---

# 5. Execution Queue

Codex must proceed sequentially unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

| Phase | Band | Task | Priority | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| 8-S1 | B | ApprovalLevel first-class + runtime schedule CRUD | P0 | completed |
| 8-S2a | B | Operator Usability Docs (First-Run + Permanent-Use + Matrices + Runbook) | P0 | completed |
| 8-S2b | B | Doctor Actionable Output + Control Center First-Run Status | P0 | completed |
| 8-S3 | B | OpenClaw Rejection Audit document | P0 | completed |

| 11-S1 | F | v1.0 security review closure | P0 | completed |
| 11-S2 | F | v1.0 permanent-use release candidate | P0 | completed |

# 6. Universal Phase Template

Each phase must follow this pattern:

```md
# Phase X-SY — Title

## Objective

## Scope

## Non-Goals

## Inspect First

## Implementation Requirements

## Safety Requirements

## Operator Usability Requirements

## Audit Requirements

## Tests

## Docs

## Validation Commands

## Manual Smoke

## Permanent-Use Check

## Acceptance Criteria

## Final Report Format
```

Do not implement a phase if the instruction is not specific enough to satisfy this template.

---

# Phase 8-S1 — ApprovalLevel first-class + runtime schedule CRUD

## Objective

Convert the draft L1/L2/L3 approval model into a first-class TypeScript workflow layer, then implement runtime `schedule.*` CRUD on top of that layer.

This phase completes the missing foundation needed for runtime automation, GitHub write, browser automation, Google integrations, and resident automation.

## Critical Correction

Do **not** collapse `ApprovalRisk`.

Keep `ApprovalRisk` as the severity axis with three levels in v0.1:

```ts
type ApprovalRisk = "low" | "medium" | "high";
```

`critical` is intentionally deferred. A 4-tier severity axis multiplies enum-comparison, test, and docs cost everywhere it is referenced, and the present design has no operation that needs to be distinguished from `high`. If a future operation genuinely cannot be served by `high -> L3_final_review`, raise it as a separate security phase and add `critical` then.

Add:

```ts
type ApprovalLevel =
  | "L1_observe"
  | "L2_operate"
  | "L3_final_review";
```

Meaning:

- `ApprovalRisk` = severity
- `ApprovalLevel` = approval workflow

Mapping:

- low read/noop/llm operations -> L1
- ordinary non-final-review state change -> L2
- final-review operation -> L3
- high risk -> L3
- schedule create/update/delete -> L3
- schedule list -> L1

## Scope

Implement:

1. `ApprovalLevel` type and derivation
2. `ApprovalEvaluation.approval_level`
3. authority trace inclusion of `approval_level`
4. final-review expansion to include schedule update/delete
5. runtime schedule schema/store
6. `schedule.create`
7. `schedule.update`
8. `schedule.delete`
9. `schedule.list`
10. existing cron lane integration
11. safe runtime snapshot counters
12. audit lifecycle events
13. tests
14. docs
15. changelog
16. phase report

## Non-Goals

Do not implement:

- GitHub write
- browser automation
- Slack / Discord release polish
- Google integrations
- Teams / LINE
- native app/menu bar distribution
- arbitrary cron expression parser
- memory authority integration
- ApprovalRisk redesign
- guided onboarding
- daemon install changes
- new external npm dependency unless justified

## Inspect First

```bash
git status --short

grep -rn "ApprovalRisk" packages/hds-brain/src apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "FINAL_REVIEW_OPERATIONS" packages/hds-brain/src apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "ApprovalMode" packages/hds-brain/src apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "BLUE_TANUKI_SCHEDULES_JSON" .
grep -rn "CronSchedulerChannel" apps/gateway/src packages
grep -rn "cron.process" packages/hds-brain/src apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "pendingApprovals" apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "runtime/snapshot" apps/gateway/src packages/channel-webchat/src
grep -rn "TOOL_SPECS" packages/hds-brain/src
grep -rn "channel_send" packages/hds-brain/src apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "ToolRegistry" packages apps
grep -rn "registerBuiltinTools" packages apps
```

Expected anchors (estimated paths — confirm by grep before editing):

```txt
packages/hds-brain/src/approval_policy.ts
packages/hds-brain/src/action_router.ts
packages/hds-brain/src/controller.ts
apps/gateway/src/approval_runtime.ts
apps/gateway/src/serve.ts
apps/gateway/src/cron_channel.ts
apps/gateway/src/plugin_loader.ts
packages/blue-tanuki/src/tools/builtin.ts
SECURITY.md
CONFIG.md
AUDIT.md
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
docs/CONFORMANCE.md
```

These paths are inferred from the repository's documented architecture; not all are guaranteed to exist with these exact names. If grep returns no match for a listed file, Codex must:

1. Search for the equivalent symbol or responsibility using the grep commands above.
2. Use the actual discovered path.
3. Report the path correction in the Final Report `Files changed` section.

Do not invent a missing file. Do not create `packages/blue-tanuki/` if no such package exists in the workspace — the tool registration site is whichever package actually exports the tool registry.

## Implementation Requirements

### ApprovalLevel

Add:

```ts
export type ApprovalLevel =
  | "L1_observe"
  | "L2_operate"
  | "L3_final_review";
```

Add derivation:

```ts
export function approvalLevelFromContext(ctx: ApprovalContext): ApprovalLevel
```

or equivalent.

Update:

- `ApprovalEvaluation`
- `AuthorityTransparencyTrace.resolved_factors`
- approval docs
- tests

### Final-review set

Ensure it contains:

```txt
tool.file.delete
tool.shell.exec
external.send
credential.access
settings.write
schedule.create
schedule.update
schedule.delete
payment.charge
```

Note on `payment.charge`: no payment functionality exists in v0.1. The entry is a **defensive placeholder** so that any future payment-class operation is forced through L3 from the moment it is introduced. Tests must assert the placeholder is present in the final-review set; tests must not exercise an actual payment path.

### Runtime schedule schema

Use existing schedule semantics.

```ts
interface RuntimeSchedule {
  id: string;
  origin: "runtime";
  enabled: boolean;
  channel: string;
  target: string;
  content: string;
  time?: string;
  interval_ms?: number;
  created_at_ms: number;
  updated_at_ms: number;
  payload_hash: string;
  status: "pending" | "active" | "disabled" | "deleted" | "rejected";
}
```

Do not add arbitrary cron syntax.

### ENV

Add if needed:

```bash
BLUE_TANUKI_SCHEDULES_DIR=.blue-tanuki/schedules
BLUE_TANUKI_SCHEDULE_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS=86400000
```

### Tool commands

Support:

```txt
tool:schedule.list
tool:schedule.create channel=webchat target=local-user content="runtime smoke" interval_ms=120000
tool:schedule.update id=<id> content="updated smoke"
tool:schedule.delete id=<id>
```

JSON form:

```txt
tool:schedule.create {"channel":"webchat","target":"local-user","content":"runtime smoke","interval_ms":120000}
```

Capabilities:

```txt
tool:schedule.list
schedule:read

tool:schedule.create
schedule:create

tool:schedule.update
schedule:update

tool:schedule.delete
schedule:delete
```

### Pending behavior

- create requested -> pending -> approval -> active
- create rejected/timeout -> not active
- update requested -> pending while old schedule remains active
- update approved -> atomic replace
- update rejected/timeout -> old schedule remains active
- delete requested -> pending while old schedule remains active
- delete approved -> disabled/deleted and unregistered
- delete rejected/timeout -> old schedule remains active
- conflicting update/delete while pending -> reject

### Scheduler lane

Boot-time and runtime schedules must share one effective scheduler lane.

Add `origin`:

```ts
origin: "boot" | "runtime"
```

Do not expose `content` in runtime snapshot.

Snapshot may expose:

```ts
runtime_schedules_count: number
pending_schedule_approvals_count: number
scheduled_tasks: safe metadata only
```

### Audit lifecycle

Record:

```txt
schedule.lifecycle.requested
schedule.lifecycle.approved
schedule.lifecycle.rejected
schedule.lifecycle.activated
schedule.lifecycle.updated
schedule.lifecycle.deleted
schedule.lifecycle.fired
```

Can use existing `authority_event` / `command_lifecycle` if new audit kind is too invasive.

Required fields:

- schedule_id
- origin
- operation
- actor
- approval_level
- risk
- payload_hash
- previous_payload_hash when applicable
- command_id
- request_id
- timestamp

## Operator Usability Requirements

This phase is not an onboarding phase, but schedule errors must already be owner-usable.

For every schedule rejection/error, output must answer:

- what failed,
- whether anything was activated,
- whether the schedule can still fire,
- next action,
- audit reference when available.

## Tests

Required:

- ApprovalLevel classification
- final-review operation list
- full_access containment
- reusable grant non-bypass
- schedule list L1
- schedule create/update/delete L3
- valid schedule create
- invalid id/channel/target/content/time/interval
- duplicate active schedule rejection
- create pending/approved/rejected/timeout
- update pending/approved/rejected/timeout
- delete pending/approved/rejected/timeout
- pending conflict rejection
- runtime schedule fires through cron/HDS path
- trusted metadata required for channel_send
- boot-time schedule regression
- Daily Brief regression
- audit chain valid
- runtime snapshot invariants unchanged

## Docs

Update:

```txt
SECURITY.md
CONFIG.md
AUDIT.md
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
docs/phase8-s1-approval-level-runtime-schedule.md
```

## Validation Commands

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm smoke:live
pnpm run doctor
pnpm validate:packaging
pnpm release:bundle -- --dry-run
```

For this phase, `pnpm smoke:serve` and `pnpm smoke:resume` are optional unless the task
explicitly targets CI, smoke checks, root workspace resolution, or release validation.
They are no longer classified as known environment failures.

## Manual Smoke

1. Start gateway with full access.
2. Submit `tool:schedule.create ... interval_ms=120000`.
3. Confirm pending approval.
4. Approve.
5. Confirm activation.
6. Confirm message fires.
7. Confirm audit lifecycle.
8. Delete schedule.
9. Approve delete.
10. Confirm no further fires.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `ApprovalLevel` exists.
- `ApprovalRisk` is three-tier (`low | medium | high`) and `critical` is intentionally absent in v0.1.
- L1/L2/L3 behavior is tested.
- schedule create/update/delete are L3.
- schedule list is L1.
- pending schedules do not run.
- rejected schedules do not run.
- boot-time schedules still work.
- audit remains valid.
- runtime invariants unchanged.
- schedule errors are owner-actionable.
- docs updated.
- validation reported.

# Phase 8-S2a — Operator Usability Docs

## Objective

Produce the documentation that lets an owner safely run BLUE-TANUKI v0.1 beyond first-run success.

This Phase is docs-only. No runtime code changes. Splitting docs from the doctor/Control-Center code changes (Phase 8-S2b) keeps each PR reviewable and prevents the docs from drifting against not-yet-written code.

## Scope

Create or update:

1. First-run checklist
2. Permanent-use checklist
3. Channel readiness matrix
4. Credential readiness matrix
5. Update / rollback / recovery runbook
6. README.md operator path
7. QUICKSTART.md alignment
8. CONFIG.md alignment
9. TROUBLESHOOTING.md alignment
10. CHANGELOG.md entry
11. Phase 8-S2a report

## Non-Goals

- no doctor code change (Phase 8-S2b)
- no Control Center status endpoint change (Phase 8-S2b)
- no new channel
- no new tool
- no native app rewrite
- no "5-minute" marketing claim unless criteria are actually met

## Inspect First

```bash
grep -rn "setup" README.md QUICKSTART.md CONFIG.md docs apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "doctor" README.md QUICKSTART.md CONFIG.md docs apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "WEBCHAT_TOKEN" README.md QUICKSTART.md CONFIG.md docs apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" README.md QUICKSTART.md CONFIG.md docs apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "release:bundle" .
grep -rn "rollback\|update\|uninstall" README.md QUICKSTART.md docs install apps/gateway/src
grep -rn "runtime schedule outside v0.1" .
```

Note: `pnpm setup` is **already implemented** in Phase 6-S1 and exists in the repo. Phase 8-S2a strengthens the operator-usability surface around it, not the command itself.

## Implementation Requirements

### First-run checklist

Create:

```txt
docs/FIRST_RUN_CHECKLIST.md
```

Must include:

- prerequisites,
- setup command (reference existing `pnpm setup`),
- env/token expectations,
- start command,
- open Control Center,
- send first WebChat message,
- optional Telegram setup,
- expected success output,
- common failure cases,
- next action for each failure.

### Permanent-use checklist

Create:

```txt
docs/PERMANENT_USE_CHECKLIST.md
```

Must include:

- startup,
- stop/restart,
- config location,
- credential location/handling,
- audit verification,
- approval queue,
- runtime schedules,
- channel readiness,
- update,
- rollback,
- uninstall/purge,
- backup/restore,
- known limitations.

### Channel readiness matrix

Create:

```txt
docs/CHANNEL_READINESS_MATRIX.md
```

Fields per channel:

- channel,
- status (first-party / preview / reserved-third-party),
- setup difficulty,
- credential requirement,
- live smoke support,
- skip path support,
- inbound support,
- outbound support,
- rate limit/backoff status,
- known failure modes,
- next phase.

### Credential readiness matrix

Create:

```txt
docs/CREDENTIAL_READINESS_MATRIX.md
```

Fields per credential/env:

- credential/env,
- required for,
- secret class,
- setup source,
- doctor check (record current state; do not change doctor code here),
- safe missing behavior,
- failure message,
- rotation notes.

### Update / rollback runbook

Create:

```txt
docs/UPDATE_ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK.md
```

Do not claim auto-update unless implemented.

Must include:

- source install update,
- release bundle update,
- config preservation,
- audit/session/memory preservation,
- rollback,
- doctor after update,
- when to stop,
- when to purge.

### README / QUICKSTART / CONFIG / TROUBLESHOOTING alignment

- README.md must link to the new docs above.
- QUICKSTART.md must reference the first-run checklist as the long-form companion.
- CONFIG.md must be consistent with the credential readiness matrix.
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md must be consistent with documented failure modes.
- Any stale wording that describes runtime schedule creation as outside v0.1 must be removed (Phase 8-S1 supersedes it).

## OpenClaw Rejection Constraint

Do not claim "beginner can use in 5 minutes" unless the repo has a tested flow satisfying:

- clean environment,
- documented OS,
- prerequisite check,
- setup command,
- start command,
- Control Center open,
- first message success,
- doctor success or actionable warning,
- no unexplained daemon/credential state.

If the repo does not meet this, state in the docs:

```md
v0.1 provides a guided first-run path, not a verified 5-minute beginner guarantee.
```

The OpenClaw-style "5-minute" claim is treated as an anti-pattern. Honest first-run language is preferred over marketing parity.

## Tests

Static checks only (no runtime code change):

- every doc path referenced by README.md / QUICKSTART.md exists,
- readiness matrices parse if structured,
- no doc contradicts CONFIG.md ENV definitions,
- no stale runtime-schedule-disabled text remains after Phase 8-S1,
- compatibility matrix status is consistent across docs.

If the repo lacks a docs-link checker, add a minimal one under `scripts/` and wire it into `pnpm test` or a dedicated `pnpm docs:check` script.

## Docs

Update:

```txt
README.md
QUICKSTART.md
CONFIG.md
TROUBLESHOOTING.md
docs/FIRST_RUN_CHECKLIST.md
docs/PERMANENT_USE_CHECKLIST.md
docs/CHANNEL_READINESS_MATRIX.md
docs/CREDENTIAL_READINESS_MATRIX.md
docs/UPDATE_ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK.md
docs/phase8-s2a-operator-usability-docs.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

## Validation Commands

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm run doctor
pnpm validate:packaging
pnpm release:bundle -- --dry-run
```

No new runtime behavior expected, so smoke is unchanged.

## Acceptance Criteria

- owner can follow docs without knowing code internals,
- no false 5-minute claim anywhere in repo,
- first-run and permanent-use are separated documents,
- channel and credential readiness are explicit,
- update/rollback story exists,
- runtime invariants remain unchanged (no code changed),
- docs-link checker passes,
- validation reported.

# Phase 8-S2b — Doctor Actionable Output + Control Center First-Run Status

## Objective

Make `doctor` diagnostics owner-actionable and expose enough safe runtime state through Control Center / runtime snapshot to answer first-run and permanent-use questions without leaking secrets.

This Phase is code-focused. It depends on Phase 8-S2a docs being in place so that doctor and Control Center output can link to authoritative docs.

## Scope

1. Doctor JSON / human output gains structured remediation fields.
2. Control Center / runtime snapshot exposes first-run status answers.
3. Tests for doctor schema and runtime snapshot fields.
4. Docs updated to reflect the new fields.

## Non-Goals

- no new doc creation (Phase 8-S2a covers docs)
- no new channel
- no GitHub write
- no browser automation
- no Google integration
- no native app rewrite

## Inspect First

```bash
grep -rn "doctor" apps/gateway/src scripts packages
grep -rn "runtime/snapshot" apps/gateway/src packages/channel-webchat/src
grep -rn "ControlCenter\|control_center\|control-center" .
grep -rn "first_run\|first-run\|firstRun" .
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Doctor actionable output

Every warning/error in doctor output must map to:

```md
status         (ok | warning | error)
cause          (one-line)
impact         (what is affected)
next_action    (concrete command or doc reference)
doc_ref        (doc file or anchor in this repo)
safe_to_ignore (true | false)
```

Both JSON and human-readable output must carry these fields (JSON authoritative; human output derived).

If, after this PR, certain legacy doctor messages still cannot be mapped, the PR must:

- list them explicitly in `docs/phase8-s2b-doctor-gap.md` as a follow-up,
- mark each as `safe_to_ignore: false` with `next_action: "report to maintainer"` until properly mapped.

### Control Center first-run status

Control Center or runtime snapshot must expose enough safe information to answer:

- Is gateway running?
- Is HDS invariant state healthy?
- Is WebChat ready?
- Is Telegram configured?
- Are there pending approvals?
- Are runtime schedules pending/active?
- Is audit chain valid?
- What is the next recommended action?

No secrets. No schedule payload content. No credential values. Counts and statuses only.

Extend `/runtime/snapshot` (or equivalent) with:

```ts
{
  gateway_status: "running" | "starting" | "degraded",
  hds_invariants_ok: boolean,
  webchat_ready: boolean,
  telegram_configured: boolean,
  pending_approvals_count: number,
  runtime_schedules_count: number,
  pending_schedule_approvals_count: number,
  audit_chain_valid: boolean,
  next_recommended_action: string | null
}
```

`next_recommended_action` must be a short human-readable hint such as `"Configure TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN to enable Telegram"` or `null` if the system is healthy and idle.

## Safety Requirements

- doctor output must not leak secret values,
- runtime snapshot must not expose schedule payload `content`,
- `next_recommended_action` must not contain credentials,
- runtime invariants 5-tuple remains unchanged,
- audit chain validation result must reflect the actual chain state.

## Tests

- doctor JSON schema validation,
- doctor remediation fields present for every status entry,
- runtime snapshot new fields present and typed,
- secrets-leak negative test on doctor and snapshot output,
- runtime invariants unchanged,
- existing doctor / snapshot regression tests still pass.

## Docs

Update:

```txt
README.md
TROUBLESHOOTING.md
docs/phase8-s2b-doctor-and-status.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

## Validation Commands

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm smoke:live
pnpm run doctor
pnpm validate:packaging
pnpm release:bundle -- --dry-run
```

For this phase, `pnpm smoke:serve` and `pnpm smoke:resume` are optional unless the task
explicitly targets CI, smoke checks, root workspace resolution, or release validation.
They are no longer classified as known environment failures.

## Manual Smoke

1. Start gateway with no Telegram token configured.
2. Call `pnpm run doctor`; confirm every warning includes `status / cause / impact / next_action / doc_ref / safe_to_ignore`.
3. Hit `/runtime/snapshot`; confirm new fields including `telegram_configured: false` and a meaningful `next_recommended_action`.
4. Configure Telegram; rerun doctor and snapshot; confirm `telegram_configured: true` and `next_recommended_action` advances.

## Acceptance Criteria

- doctor output is owner-actionable,
- doctor JSON schema is tested,
- Control Center / snapshot answers first-run status questions,
- no secret leakage,
- runtime invariants unchanged,
- validation reported.

# Phase 8-S3 — OpenClaw Rejection Audit Document

## Objective

Create an explicit internal engineering document recording the criteria by which OpenClaw's design pattern is rejected as a basis for BLUE-TANUKI, and the specific roadmap consequences that follow.

This is an internal engineering document, not marketing material. It exists so that no future Codex run reintroduces OpenClaw assumptions by drift, and so that the rejection criteria are reviewable as a single artifact.

## Output

Create:

```txt
docs/OPENCLAW_REJECTION_AUDIT.md
```

## Required Sections

1. Scope and intent (engineering audit, not commentary)
2. What OpenClaw appears to optimize
3. Why BLUE-TANUKI rejects each of those optimizations
4. 5-minute setup claim — rejection of marketing parity
5. Permanent-use UX — why BLUE-TANUKI treats this as a release gate instead
6. Channel breadth — why count is rejected as a quality metric
7. Safety boundary — what BLUE-TANUKI requires that OpenClaw's pattern does not
8. Update/rollback — what BLUE-TANUKI requires that OpenClaw's pattern does not
9. Skills/plugin supply-chain — why BLUE-TANUKI rejects unsigned third-party skill execution
10. WhatsApp ecosystem — why first-party exclusion is a safety + liability boundary, not a deferral
11. Adopt / Adapt / Reject / Reserve table (carried from this instruction file)
12. Resulting BLUE-TANUKI roadmap effects

## Acceptance Criteria

- no marketing tone,
- no feature-count framing,
- explicit rejection criteria stated in engineering terms,
- WhatsApp exclusion explained as deliberate safety + liability boundary,
- concrete roadmap effects listed,
- claims about OpenClaw phrased as "comparison target observations" rather than asserted facts about that project,
- file committed and linked from AGENTS.md if appropriate.

## Non-Goals

- Gateway adapter wiring
- Control Center history / replay UI
- SQLite / SQLCipher
- encrypted history store
- LLM backend integration
- authority use of complete history

## Completion Notes

- Added standalone `CompleteHistoryStore` inside `packages/hds-brain`.
- Added complete-history entry kinds for user input, LLM history, HDS decisions, approval history, execution history, audit history, and final output.
- Added append / verify / replay / export / JSON export baseline.
- Added JSONL persistence with load-time chain verification.
- Public replay/export APIs return copies so callers cannot mutate the live in-memory chain.
- Complete history remains original-record/replay evidence with `used_for_authority=false` and `complete_history_used_for_authority=false`.
- Active execution lane advances to Phase 12-S3 Runtime Invariants Evidence Upgrade.

# Phase 12-S3 - Runtime Invariants Evidence Upgrade

## Objective

Promote Runtime Invariants from fixed display values to HDS-BRAIN-owned evidence that can be inspected, verified, and audited.

## Scope

Create:

## Non-Goals

- final-review operation single-source refactor
- fail-safe/self-health policy redesign
- detector lifecycle implementation
- Control Center visual redesign
- authority use of Runtime Invariants evidence

## Completion Notes

- Added standalone Runtime Invariants evidence generation inside `packages/hds-brain`.
- `HDSRuntimeSnapshot` preserves `invariants` and adds `runtime_invariants` evidence report.
- Added expected/actual values, per-invariant evidence, guarantee kind, all-ok status, report digest, and non-authority flags.
- Added `runtime_invariants` HDS audit record and `HDSUpperController.onRuntimeInvariantsEvidence`.
- Standalone harness emits runtime invariant evidence and appends it to audit.
- Gateway startup records runtime invariant evidence and runtime snapshot displays it as downstream data.
- Audit dump and authority trace project runtime invariant evidence.
- Active execution lane advances to Phase 12-S4 Final-review Operation Single Source of Truth.

# Phase 12-S4 - Final-review Operation Single Source of Truth

## Objective

Make final-review operations a single HDS-BRAIN-owned source of truth.

## Scope

Create:

```txt
packages/hds-brain/test/final_review_operations.test.ts
docs/phase12-s4-final-review-single-source.md

```

## Non-Goals

- Approval UI redesign
- history / replay UI wiring
- detector lifecycle changes
- fail-safe policy redesign
- new privileged operation classes
- gateway-owned final-review policy source

## Completion Notes

- Added `FINAL_REVIEW_OPERATION_LIST` as the canonical HDS-BRAIN final-review operation list.
- Kept `FINAL_REVIEW_OPERATIONS` as a derived set and added `finalReviewOperationList()` for copied projections.
- Process approval profiles, authority traces, and Runtime Invariants evidence now derive from the same HDS-BRAIN list.
- Tests cover drift across Approval Gate, process profile, authority trace, and runtime evidence.
- Active execution lane advances to Phase 12-S5 Approval / Notification / History / Replay UI Completion.

# Global Validation Command Set

Use this set after major phases:

Package-manager preflight:

```bash
node --version
corepack --version || true
pnpm --version || true
```

If `pnpm` is unavailable, follow `docs/known-environment-failures.md` and report validation as
environment-limited if recovery fails.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm docs:check
```

For implementation phases also run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm run doctor
pnpm validate:packaging
```

For unrelated feature work, follow the active phase validation boundary. `pnpm smoke:serve` and `pnpm smoke:resume` are skipped unless the phase targets root workspace resolution, smoke checks, CI, or release validation. `pnpm smoke:live` may SKIP when credentials are absent.

For release phases also run:

```bash
pnpm release:bundle
pnpm release:verify
```

If unavailable, report exactly.

---

# Global Final Report Format

Every phase must end with:

```md
## Files changed

## Summary

## Strategic frame impact

## GA bar impact

## Layer separation impact

## HDS authority impact

## Approval Gate impact

## Runtime Invariants impact

## Audit impact

## Capability envelope impact

## Conformance impact

## Tests / validation

## Known environment failures

## Remaining risks

## Recommended next phase
```

Do not hide failed tests.

Do not claim completion unless acceptance criteria are satisfied.
