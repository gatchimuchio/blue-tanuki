# Skill Loader Contract

## 1. Purpose

Skill Loader Contract defines how Layer B skills are discovered, declared, permissioned, loaded, disabled, and kept downstream-only.

Skills may provide tools, templates, prompts, adapters, or helper workflows. Skills do not create authority.

## 2. Skill Discovery Path

Skills are discovered only from approved workspace package roots or explicitly configured repository-local skill paths.

The loader must not dynamically import arbitrary external npm packages at runtime. External dynamic import is rejected unless a future security phase explicitly changes this policy.

Layer B skill submissions must pass Plugin Review Gate before acceptance:

```bash
pnpm plugin:review -- --package <skill-package-dir>
```

The submitted package must include `blue-tanuki.review.json`, declare `external_dynamic_imports: false`, and declare `hot_reload: false`. Review is static and must not import or execute the skill entry point.

## 3. Skill Manifest Schema

A skill manifest must include:

- name
- version
- kind
- entry point
- description
- capability declarations
- optional credential names
- optional network hosts
- optional filesystem/process scopes
- support status

Missing manifests fail closed.

## 4. Capability Declaration Requirements

Every skill capability must be explicit:

- network hosts
- filesystem roots or prefixes
- process execution requirements
- credential names
- memory read/write/reference needs
- notification or external send needs

Capabilities are reviewed against [Capability Envelope](CAPABILITY_ENVELOPE.md). Undeclared access is denied.

## 5. Sandbox Boundary

Skills execute inside the repository-defined sandbox boundary:

- no implicit filesystem reach
- no implicit network reach
- no implicit shell/process reach
- no implicit credential reach
- no persistent profile or credential reuse
- no channel metadata authority

Sandbox failures must include owner next action.

## 6. Load-Time Permission Enforcement

Permission enforcement happens at load time before the skill can run.

The loader must:

- parse manifest
- validate schema
- compare declared capabilities with allowed envelope
- apply Plugin Review Gate evidence for Layer B submissions
- reject unsupported capability classes
- record review result for doctor/reporting
- fail closed on invalid state

## 7. Runtime Authority Non-Bypass Guarantee

At runtime, a skill must not:

- inject commands into HDS-BRAIN authority
- approve requests
- resume suspended requests
- widen actor/process authority
- treat plugin/skill metadata as authority
- bypass L3 final-review
- bypass audit

Skill output is downstream evidence or content only.

## 8. Skill Disable / Revoke

The loader must support:

- disabling a skill
- revoking a skill capability
- reporting disabled/revoked state
- preserving audit history
- fail-closed behavior after disable

Disable/revoke must not silently remove evidence.

## 9. No Hot-Reload Policy

Skills are boot-time loaded only.

No hot reload is allowed in v1.0 GA because runtime replacement of executable extension code is authority-adjacent and hard to audit.

Changing this policy requires a standalone security phase.
