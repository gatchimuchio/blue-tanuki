# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Replaced repository-wide Codex agent rules in `AGENTS.md` with the Phase 8/v1.0 completion posture.
- Added `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` as the active execution plan, with Phase 8-S1 (`ApprovalLevel` first-class + runtime schedule CRUD) as the next implementation lane.
- Replaced `docs/ROADMAP.md` with a v9 roadmap aligned to the active implementation instructions.
- Added Phase 8-S1: first-class `ApprovalLevel`, three-tier `ApprovalRisk`, L3 runtime schedule create/update/delete, safe schedule snapshots, and schedule lifecycle audit.
- Advanced active implementation docs to Phase 8-S2a after Phase 8-S1 completion.
- Added Phase 8-S2a operator-usability docs: first-run checklist, permanent-use checklist, channel readiness matrix, credential readiness matrix, update/rollback runbook, and docs static checker.
- Added Phase 8-S2b: actionable doctor remediation fields and safe runtime first-run status fields.
- Added Phase 8-S3: internal OpenClaw rejection audit document and advanced the active execution lane to GitHub write.
- Added Phase 8-S4: authenticated `github.write` tool with repository allowlist, L3 final-review mapping, capability envelope, and audit-safe result digests.
- Added Phase 8-S5: Slack / Discord release-polished preview with typed delivery errors, adapter retry/backoff, live smoke error detail, and updated readiness docs.
- Added Phase 8-S6: disabled-by-default browser automation preview with `browser.snapshot`, guarded `browser.automation`, L2/L3 ApprovalLevel mapping, credential denial, network/resource limits, smoke skip path, and advanced the active execution lane to F-reference audit integration.
- Added Phase 9-S1: `F:<id>` memory read/write references in audit and Control Center traces while preserving `memory_used_for_authority=false`.
- Added Phase 9-S2: read-only `gmail.read`, `google.calendar.read`, and `google.drive.read` tools, credential-scoped Google Daily Brief source, doctor/docs coverage, and advanced the active execution lane to Google write.
- Added Phase 9-S3: bounded `gmail.write`, `google.calendar.write`, and `google.drive.write` tools with L3 final-review mapping, fail-closed credential handling, audit-safe mutation summaries, and advanced the active execution lane to Teams / LINE adapters.
- Added Phase 9-S4: Microsoft Teams and LINE first-party-preview adapters with capability manifests, conformance tests, live smoke skip paths, doctor/compatibility gates, typed delivery failures, and updated readiness docs.

- Fixed CI root smoke dependency resolution by declaring `ws` and `@types/ws` at the workspace root and updating `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Added CI placeholder env values so `pnpm run doctor` remains warning-free without enabling credentialed live smoke targets.
- Reclassified root `smoke:serve` / `smoke:resume` as actionable CI/release checks after the root smoke dependency repair.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-06

v0.1 release-candidate completion.

### Added

- Telegram Bot API channel package: `@blue-tanuki/channel-telegram`.
- Gateway registration for Telegram with silent fallback when `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is unset.
- Internal Daily Brief cron source that emits trusted `cron.process` requests and routes them through HDS-BRAIN as `channel_send`.
- HDS scheduled channel-send command construction from gateway-internal metadata only.
- v0.1 public docs: `QUICKSTART.md`, `CLAIM.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `AUDIT.md`, `CONFIG.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- Runtime/config docs for Telegram and Daily Brief smoke.

### Boundary

- v0.1 Daily Brief is a scheduled-message smoke, not Gmail/GCal/Drive integration.
- WhatsApp, Voice, Mobile, rich Canvas, and public third-party skill registry remain out of completion-quality scope.
- HDS memory remains deterministic and `used_for_authority=false`.

### Verification

- Static syntax check for modified emitted JavaScript: PASS.
- Dependency-based `pnpm typecheck/test` must be run in a normal dev environment with workspace dependencies installed.

### Phase 7-S4 hotfix: typecheck/build green

- Replaced the unreachable trailing return in `scopeFromCommand` with an explicit `never` exhaustive check; the ExecuteCommand union is exhaustively narrowed earlier, so the previous `return { target_scope: "command", target: command.id }` was dead code that triggered TS2339 and broke `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm build`. Runtime behavior unchanged.
- Clarified the `/resume` instruction text in `approvalRequiredMessage` to use `request_id=<command_id>` instead of the literal `request_id=command_id`, removing the impression that the parameter name and value were the same string.
- Verified: `pnpm install && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm -r test` all pass. 352 tests across 8 packages.

### Phase 7-S4: Transparent full-access authority

- Added machine-readable `authority_trace` to every approval evaluation.
- Fixed the product boundary as `full_access` default + `none_in_hds_authority_path`.
- Audit text output now prints the approval authority boundary.
- Added `docs/phase7-s4-transparent-full-access-authority.md`.
- Fixed duplicate `reason` key in the resume audit commit object.


## 0.0.3-phase7-s3b - 2026-05-05

Full-access product stance clarification.

### Changed

- Clarified that BLUE-TANUKI is designed as an owner-operated resident console with full access as the normal local default.
- Clarified that safety is implemented through HDS self-norms, final-review operations, and hash-chain audit closure rather than permission nagging.
- Clarified that disclaimers are release/responsibility boundaries, not the primary control mechanism.

### Verified

- Default approval mode: `full_access` when `BLUE_TANUKI_APPROVAL_MODE` is unset.
- Ordinary local non-final-review command: auto-allowed after HDS ASSERT.
- Shell execution: still requires final review under full access.

## 0.0.3-phase7-s3 - 2026-05-05

Resident full-access default.

### Changed

- Approval runtime now defaults to `full_access` when `BLUE_TANUKI_APPROVAL_MODE` is unset.
- Approval policy core now treats full access as the resident local-operator default.
- Control Center UI now shows Full Access as the default approval stance.
- README and Phase 7 approval docs now frame BLUE-TANUKI as a local resident control app, not a permission-nagging chatbot.

### Boundary

- Full access still does not bypass final review for file delete, shell exec, external send, credential access, settings write, payment, or schedule creation.
- `ask_every_time` remains available as explicit strict mode.

### Verified

- Static smoke confirmed default full-access allows non-final-review file write.
- Static smoke confirmed default full-access still asks for shell exec.
- Release bundle regenerated with updated manifest and SHA256.

## 0.0.3-phase7-s2 - 2026-05-05

Approval gate connected to the live executor path.

### Added

- Runtime approval gate between HDS `ASSERT` and executor execution.
- Pending approval queue for WebChat `/resume` approval by command id.
- Optional reusable approval grants via `remember=true` or `approval_mode=full_access`.
- JSON approval grant store controlled by `BLUE_TANUKI_APPROVALS_FILE`.
- Audit records for `approval_gate` and `command_lifecycle`.
- CLI/serve approval runtime with default low-risk local LLM/noop system grants.
- Phase 7-S2 design document.

### Boundary

- Full-access mode remains final-review guarded for delete, shell exec, external send, credential access, settings write, payment, and scheduling.
- Visual approval editor and native tray packaging remain deferred.

### Verified

- Emitted JavaScript syntax checks for approval policy/store/runtime/controller/gateway serve path: PASS.
- Direct approval-policy runtime smoke for allow / ask / full-access-final-review containment: PASS.
- Full `pnpm install && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` was not run in this container because workspace dependencies and `@types/node` were unavailable.

## 0.0.3-phase7-s1 - 2026-05-05

Resident Control Center and approval-policy foundation.

### Added

- Local Control Center shell served by WebChat at `/` and `/app`.
- Static app layout for Control Center / Console / Notifications / Chat.
- HDS approval-policy model: operation × target scope × risk × actor × duration.
- Approval matcher with three modes: ask every time, remember this decision, full access.
- Final-review exception list for delete, shell exec, external send, credential access, settings write, payment, and scheduling.
- Unit tests for approval matching and full-access final-review containment.
- Phase 7-S1 design document.

### Boundary

- Approval policy persistence and live approval endpoints are not implemented yet.
- Windows tray / Electron / Tauri packaging is intentionally deferred.

## 0.0.3-phase6-s10 - 2026-05-05

HDS audit-closure and release-boundary hardening.

### Added

- HDS-BRAIN now appends executor feedback as a first-class hash-chain audit event.
- Unknown/stale executor feedback is recorded as `known_command=false` instead of being silently ignored.
- Feedback audit records include command id, upstream commit hash, status, metrics, error, and SHA256 digest of returned result data.
- `/settings` is loopback-only by default when a settings token is configured; non-loopback binds require explicit `BLUE_TANUKI_ENABLE_SETTINGS=1`.

### Changed

- Human resume commit hashes are now real SHA256 hashes over the resume event, previous commit hash, actor, verdict, and timestamp.
- Release archives are named `source-bundle` instead of `portable` to avoid implying standalone execution.
- Release manifest boundary now declares `unsigned_source_bundle=true`.
- `release:verify` supports both `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archive listing.
- Audit dump renders executor feedback entries without assuming every audit record is a decision.

### Boundary

- Release archives still exclude `node_modules`; operators must run dependency installation before use.
- This remains an engineering preview, not a production autonomous agent or trust root.

### Verified

- HDS-BRAIN runtime smoke for ASSERT → executor feedback hash-chain: PASS.
- Human resume hash format and chain verification smoke: PASS.
- `release:bundle`: PASS, wrote `source-bundle.tar.gz` plus `.sha256` and `.manifest.json`.
- `release:verify`: PASS for generated `.tar.gz`.
- `release:verify -- --file <zip>` smoke: PASS with a generated test zip.
- Full `pnpm` test/build were not run in this container because `pnpm` and `@types/node` were not installed.

## 0.0.3-phase6-s9 - 2026-05-05

Release secret-backup exclusion.

### Added

- Release bundle creation now excludes env backup and secret-like files:
  `.env.bak`, `*.env.*.bak`, `blue-tanuki.env.*.bak`, key/cert-like files,
  and `.npmrc`.
- Release verification now rejects secret-like backup files if they appear in
  an archive.
- `.gitignore` now ignores env backups and common local key material.
- Packaging validation coverage for release secret-backup exclusion.

## 0.0.3-phase5-s4 - 2026-05-03

`file.search` sandbox root enforcement.

### Added

- Relative `root` arguments resolve from the sandbox root.
- Absolute `root` arguments are allowed only inside the sandbox.
- `fs.realpath` checks deny symlink escapes.
- Secret-like requested roots are denied, and secret-like paths are skipped
  during traversal.
- Tests for missing sandbox env, outside roots, symlink escape, secret root
  denial, and secret file skipping.

## 0.0.3-phase5-s3 - 2026-05-03

`http.fetch` SSRF hardening.

### Added

- DNS/IP validation for `http.fetch` before connecting.
- Deny rules for loopback, private, link-local, metadata, unique-local IPv6,
  documentation, multicast/reserved, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 targets.
- Manual redirect handling with a 3-hop limit and full validation on every
  redirect target.
- DNS-rebinding resistance by connecting with the validated resolved IP while
  preserving the original Host header / TLS server name.
- Optional domain allowlist mode via `BLUE_TANUKI_HTTP_ALLOWLIST`.
- SSRF tests for loopback, private, metadata, IPv6, IPv4-mapped IPv6, redirect
  escape, redirect limit, and allowlist behavior.

- Workspace-only dynamic import of manifest `entry` modules.
- Manifest-driven registration for built-in tools and channel classes.
- Manifest-driven live smoke construction for Slack / Discord channel checks.
- Permission enforcement for tool capabilities, channel network/secrets,
  non-stub LLM provider access, session fs access, and audit fs append access.
- Boot-fail behavior when a required permission is missing.

### Added

- Gateway doctor now validates bundled plugin manifests with the protocol
  schema.

## 0.0.3-phase4-s9 - 2026-05-03

Release-readiness pass for the Phase 4 workspace artifact.

### Added

- Internal HDS-BRAIN long-term memory addendum:
  - append-only JSONL-compatible store
  - TCP-closed ASSERT write gate
  - hash-chain verification
  - optional controller memory capture and frame reader plumbing
- Provider-neutral LLM routing:
  - arbitrary OpenAI-compatible provider catalogs via `LLM_PROVIDERS_JSON`
  - HDS-owned route hints via `BLUE_TANUKI_LLM_*`
- Tool permission envelope:
  - `allowed_capabilities`
  - built-in `echo`, `file.search`, and `http.fetch`
- HDS action routing for explicit safe tool requests.
- Gateway result rendering for `tool_call`, `noop`, and failure output.
- Live smoke harness for configured non-stub LLM, Slack, and Discord checks.

### Changed

- README and runbook now describe the current Phase 4-S9 state instead of the
  earlier S1/S3 checkpoint.
- Doctor documentation includes the current `audit_dir`, provider-catalog, and
  LLM command-route checks.
- Release checklist now includes `typecheck`, offline smokes, live smoke, and
  artifact zip refresh.
- Root `doctor` scripts now call package scripts via `run doctor` to avoid
  pnpm's built-in `doctor` command.

### Verified

- `pnpm build`: PASS
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS

Credentialed live smoke remains operator-gated because it can call external
APIs and post messages.
## Phase 7-S6 - HDS Authority / Process / Memory Hardening

- Hardened actor/process resolution: external metadata can no longer upgrade actor authority unless marked as gateway-internal authority context.
- Enforced `actor_policy` and `execution_policy` before emitting downstream commands.
- Added security FAIL outcomes for `process_authority_denied` and `process_execution_policy_denied`.
- Enriched HDS long-term memory with actor/process/commit/tags while keeping memory non-authority.
- Added deterministic actor/process lookup helpers for long-term memory.
- Exposed runtime safety invariants in `HDSRuntimeSnapshot` and Control Center copy.
